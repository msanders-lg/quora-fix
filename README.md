# quora-fix
Welcome!
This is a Tampermonkey userscript I wrote for the purpose of removing Quora.com's obstrusive login wall. It currently makes use of jQuery, but I am looking to implement the functions I make use of in order to reduce bulk.

### Usage

~~I plan to add this over on OpenUserJS~~, but you may add my userscript [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msanders-lg/quora-fix/master/quora-fix.user.js) directly if you desire.

I now have this script available on OUJS! You may download it at (https://openuserjs.org/scripts/msanders-lg/Quora_Fix). Thanks!
