# quora-fix
Welcome!
This is a Tampermonkey userscript I wrote for the purpose of removing Quora.com's obstrusive login wall. It currently makes use of jQuery, but I am looking to implement the functions I make use of in order to reduce bulk.

### Usage

I plan to add this over on OpenUserJS, but you may add my userscript [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msanders-lg/quora-fix/master/quora-fix.js) directly if you desire.
